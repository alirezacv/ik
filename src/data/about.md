# Hello ! 

I'm a PhD student in Social Psychology at the [Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_(Paris)), part of [Paris Sciences & Letters (PSL) University](https://psl.eu/en/university/psl-international-rankings). During my MPhil in Cognitive Science, I have worked on insight and its link to personality and cultural consumption which resulted in two articles (see: [Publications] )
