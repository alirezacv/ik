# Intro

I'm Marc, a computer science student at KTH and love studying here. However, computer science isn't everything in my life (I know, very surprsing).
Here, you can learn a little bit about me.
<!-- When I was in my bachelors, I wanted to go on exchange to Norway, however COVID happened. So, after I finished my degree, 
I decided to just go for it and do a full degree programm in Norway. The experience of living abroad has been great and
meeting so many new people and cultures is great. After I finished my (first) master's degree in Norway, I felt like I still 
hadn't learned enough and decided to do another master's. Of course abroad again! So in August 2023, I moved to Sweden
and have been doing my master's there ever since. -->

# This Website

Have I made this website by myself? Yesn't! This is a fork of [Michael d'Angelo's website](https://mldangelo.com/). However,
I have changed some of the things to my liking and obviously changed the contents. If you want to adapt the original website as
well, you should probably visit his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mldangelo/personal-site) (it's really not that complicated).
