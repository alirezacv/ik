I'm an incoming PhD candidate in Experimental Social Psychology at the [Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_(Paris)), part of [Paris Sciences & Letters (PSL) University](https://psl.eu/en/university/psl-international-rankings).

# Data Science Freelance

Aside my academic research, I also offer my services as a freelance Data Scientist. For the moment, I do not accept new clients. 

# What I do

- If you don't find me coding, I'm probably reading. 
- If not reading, I'm bouldering. 
- If not bouldering, I'm playing video games. 
- But if you find me writing, it's a lucky day.
